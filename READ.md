This project was developed for the course "Applied Project for Data Science I" in the Data Science Bachelor we frequent. 
It consists in the prediction of the optimal number of bikes to provide in Seoul, duuring a certain hour of the day, considering metereological conditions, 
the season of the year, and special cases of big events that may lead to the increase of bike rentals, instead of the use of public transportation.
